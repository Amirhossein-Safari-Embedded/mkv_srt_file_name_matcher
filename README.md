# MKV-SRT File Name Matcher

The MKV-SRT File Name Matcher is a Python program designed to simplify the task of matching the names of a collection of `.mkv` and `.srt` files in a folder. It automates the process of sequentially renaming `.srt` files to match the corresponding `.mkv` file names.

## Usage

### Standalone Executable Version

If you prefer not to run commands manually, a standalone executable version of the program is available. Follow these steps to use the executable:

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/Amirhossein-Safari-Embedded/mkv_srt_file_name_matcher/releases) page.

2. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a folder of your choice.

3. Ensure that the `.mkv` and `.srt` files you want to match are located in the same folder as the executable.

4. Double-click on the executable file to run it.

5. The program will list the `.mkv` and `.srt` files found in the current folder and automatically rename the `.srt` files to match the corresponding `.mkv` file names.

6. After the renaming process is complete, a success message will be displayed.

### Command Line Version

If you prefer to run the program using the command line, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file and extract its contents.
